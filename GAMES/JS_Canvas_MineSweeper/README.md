### This is Minesweeper.

Recently I created Minesweeper using Python and PyGame.

I understand and I renembered that I need to refactor this.

Wish me luck.

26.06.2025 (dd.mm.yyyy) I made progress. I have 7 JavaScript files, 1 css file and 1 html file. Must admit it is not the most basic minesweeper. Can I improve the code more? Maybe add comments? My fear / consern is that if begginer looks at my code, would he be able to understand how it works?

Maybe I should make video about this?
