Setting up the project: We'll create the necessary HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

Creating the game board: We'll generate a grid of candies on the canvas.

Implementing candy swapping: We'll allow players to swap candies by clicking or dragging.

Checking for matches: We'll detect and handle matching candies.

Handling cascading effects: When candies are cleared, we'll handle the cascading effect where candies fall down to fill the empty spaces.

Adding game logic: Implement game rules, such as level completion conditions and scoring.

Implementing user interface elements: We'll add features like a score display, level indicator, and game over screen.

Adding animations and effects: We can enhance the game's visuals with animations and effects.

Let's start with step 1: setting up the project. We'll create the HTML structure, link the CSS and JavaScript files, and set up the canvas element. Here's a basic example to get us started:
