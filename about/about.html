        You can create Tik-Tak-Toe using html divs, but as you can see it is bad
        idea to create snake game.

        You guessed it. This is my second game using HTML canvas. It have grown
        over time. Now you can pick "Square size", "Game Speed" and "Pause
        Game". There are also two 'Secred Codes' one of them allow you to enable
        'Auto Play' second 'Fills 90% with completed snake'. It is your job to
        figure out those codes :P. Almost forgot then you pause the game and
        enter cheat code with keyboard (sorry mobile users) you can add 10000
        points to your score.

        It is raycasting. It is amazing. It converts 2D game into "3D game".
        From top view to first person view. None of this code is mine. I watched
        YouTube video and created this.

        This was not my first time I have created Logic for MineSweeper. You can
        customize game field, but there are limits. There is also cheat code to
        reaveal all mines. Remind me to include some screenshots from my
        MineSweeper game clones (C#, Python and JavaScript). After multiple
        failed attepnts to watch YouTube or search in github.com I asked ChatGPT
        algorith how to reveal cells (where all near cells "number of mines" is
        0)

        Another interesting game clone. This game can teach you bit more about
        array manipulation. Also in this came there are secrets. You can sort
        numbers from highest to lowest and double value of each number in game.

          At first you could play this game only mouse or fingers in mobile. But
          now you can also use keyboard (wasd).

        Simple pong game. Had to use ChatGPT, because I am not so good with
        angles in game development.

        To create most basic version of this game it is kinda easy. But to
        create full version of this game I think it is hard. You have to know
        how to find maching candies. They can be in different variations and
        places. Then you need to know how to create amazing animations. I found
        algorith on internet that finds all matching candies...

      This was fun game to create. Had to ask for help to AI about colision
      detection between walls and player.

        It is just black square and red pipes. UI could be better. But it in
        simple game to learn for somebody that is new to programming.
